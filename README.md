# Improved High Order Model-Free Adaptive Control (IHOMFAC)
Python implementation of the IHOMFAC algorithm proposed in the paper "Improved High Order Model-Free Adaptive Control" by Jian Xu; Na Lin; Ronghu Chi. The IHOMFAC algorithm is an improved version of the traditional high-order model-free adaptive control (HOMFAC) algorithm, which considers more information from previous time steps to enhance control performance.

## Installation
To use this project, you will need to have Python 3 installed on your system. You can then install the required dependencies using pip:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`


## Results
The simulation in the notebook shows that the IHOMFAC method has superior control performance than the traditional high-order MFAC. The results are presented in the paper "Improved High Order Model-Free Adaptive Control" by Zhang et al.
